            This is the page for csc412 and student of SFSU.
            Killed by a Sage Emperor and reborn as his 13 year 
            old self, Nie Li was given a second chance at life. 
            A second chance to change everything and save his loved 
            ones and his beloved city. He shall once again battle with 
            the Sage Emperor to avenge his death and those of his beloved .

            With the vast knowledge of hundred years of life he accumulated 
            in his previous life, he shall have a new starting point. Although
            he started as the weakest, without a doubt, he will climb the steps 
            towards the strongest. Cultivating the strongest cultivation 
            technique, wielding the strongest demon spirits, he shall reach the 
            pinnacle of Martial Arts. Enmities of the past will be settled in 
            this new lifetime.

            “Since I’m back, then in this lifetime, I shall become the King of 
            the Gods that dominate everything. Let everything else tremble 
            beneath my feet!”
                
            In the Sky Sword Continent there are thousands of sects and strong 
            cultivators as common as trees. In order to prevent his older sister 
            from being forcefully married off, Lu Xuan had no choice to but to 
            unceasingly cultivate and enter a sect to ask for a favor. By chance, 
            a sword-shaped crystal of mysterious origins entered into Lu Xuan’s body, 
            containing countless top-class martial skills, powerful martial arts, and 
            everything you could wish for! A martial legend starts here…
                
            Jian Chen, the publicly recognized number one expert of the Jianghu. His 
            skill with the sword went beyond perfection and was undefeatable in battle, 
            After a battle with the exceptional expert Dugu Qiubai who had gone missing 
            over a hundred years ago, Jian Chen succumbed to his injuries and died.

            After death, Jian Chen’s spirit was transmigrated into a completely foreign 
            world. Following an extremely fast growth, his enemies piled up one after 
            another before becoming gravely injured once more. On the gates of death, 
            his spirit had mutated, and from that moment henceforth, he would tread on a 
            completely different path of the art of the sword to become the sword god of 
            his generation.
                
            “THE NEW GATE”, an online game that trapped its players and turned into a death 
            game, was now releasing the thousands of players that had been dragged into it, 
            thanks to the efforts of Shin, one of the most powerful players. But after having 
            defeated the last boss and freed everyone, he was swallowed up by a strange light 
            and found himself inside the game world 500 years in the future and unable to leave.

            Note: Volumes 1 & 2 by Shin Translations were translated from the Web Novel while 
            Volume 3 was translated from the Light Novel.
